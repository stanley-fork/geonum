# changelog

## 0.15.0 (2026-06-23)

### added
- `Geonum::spread` — the inverse-power / point-source field op, `scale(1/boundary.mag).rotate(boundary.angle)`, a named composition the way `project` is a named `cos`. square-free over a solid angle (flux → intensity), the `1/r^k` field over an area whose grade IS the falloff exponent; composes as `x.spread(a).spread(b) == x.spread(a*b)`
- geometry_test: point, line, and metric as rotations/projections — the metric as the self-cancelling π dual (`e² = −1`), a line as a projection (sign = the cosine, "negative" = a π turn), length as the magnitude vs the `√(x²+y²)` repair, length in any dimension without a squared sum
- cosmology_test: redshift as a boost (Bondi `k = e^φ`), comoving distance as the rapidity, velocity as `tanh φ`, expansion as magnitude scaling — the coasting distance-redshift law with no density parameter
- field_test: the inverse-square field via `spread` (gravity and charge alike), superposition as `wave_sum`, the falloff exponent as the boundary's grade
- orbit_test: an orbit as a rotation at fixed magnitude, the ω/rate split, spiral winding as a blade count, the rotation-curve residual, mercury precession

### changed
- `electric_field`/`inverse_field` route through `Geonum::spread` — the inverse-square is a spread over the grade-2 wedge area, no `powf`, the field direction falling out of the area's grade
- astrophysics_test rebuilt as inter-body dynamics matched to observation: binary period (Sirius ~50 yr), Earth–Sun L1 (SOHO, 1.5 M km), equilateral three-body (L4/L5), light deflection (eddington 1.75″), Earth–Mars conjunction (780 d), one influence law from surface gravity to orbit
- em_field_theory_test rebuilt around what two numbers do that the tensor cannot: the field in 2 values (vs `F_μν` ~ n²), the Poynting flux as the wedge where no cross product exists, curl as a grade-raising rotation — all in any dimension
- `quaternion_test::it_is_a_plane` → `its_a_plane`

## 0.14.0 (2026-06-14)

### removed
- `affine` trait and feature — translate was `+`, shear was `rotate`; the layer only re-vocabularied the core

### fixed
- chemistry `electron_affinity` signs by subshell continuity (was a grade proxy), matching NIST except nitrogen
- `it_computes_ijk_product`, `its_an_octonion`: assert the primitive product's commutativity/associativity (`i·j = k`, `ijk = −1`) instead of bailing on the non-commutativity/non-associativity the decomposition table adds back (linear_algebra_test)

### added
- projection_test, curve_test, integral_test, exponential_test: line, area, and the integral as angle-first ops; `wave_sum` interference coverage in geocollection_test
- quaternion_test: the quaternion product factored — commutative rotor (`*`) and anti-symmetric wedge (`a∧b = −b∧a`), `ijk = −1` in blade arithmetic, rotation composition order-dependent by exactly the geometric angle; plus a guard test that `e3∧e1 = 0` is a dropped-blade shadow, not a broken cycle

## 0.13.0 (2026-05-24)

### breaking
- `Geonum::disperse` now carries the phase `kx − ωt` in the angle (was a sign-only blade) — `disperse` finally matches its docstring; the return is `[1, kx − ωt]`, so `.cos_sin()` reads the wave

### fixed
- `Angle::boost(0.0)` returns the `(grade 2, t = 0)` backward pole instead of `NaN` — the horizon limit, every ray collapsing to one null direction

### added
- general relativity test series: schwarzschild_test (the bondi field — redshift, precession, horizon), einstein_test (the field equation as one local condition on that field), gravitational_wave_test (`disperse` on the light cone), sr_gr_collapse_test (SR/GR as one boost, the knob constant or position/time-varying)

### changed
- split dimension_test.rs into pseudoscalar_test.rs (the 2^n/pseudoscalar elimination) and grade_test.rs (grades and the k→4−k duality)

## 0.12.1 (2026-05-22)

### added
- `GeoCollection::wave_sum` — interfering vector sum of a collection (the superposition), the counterpart to `total_magnitude`; `wave_sum().mag <= total_magnitude()`, the gap is angular cancellation
- `Angle::boost(k)` — celestial-sphere (relativistic aberration) boost: scales the stored half-tangent by the Bondi factor `k` via the grade-keyed Cayley maps, rational, no trig
- `Geonum::boost(axis, k)` — Lorentz event boost: projection onto the two light-cone nulls (a quarter turn apart) scaled by `k` and `1/k`, interval-preserving, for any boost axis
- `chemistry` feature: `Chemistry` extension trait on `Geonum` deriving the periodic table from blade arithmetic — `madelung_order`, `electron_shell`/`electron_wave`, `valence_shell`/`relativistic_valence_shell`, `ionization_projection`, and the observables `ionization_energy` (IE1, IE2, successive), `electron_affinity`, `electronegativity`; configured by the `Lattice` enum (`Canonical`/`Custom`), validated against NIST
- spacetime_test.rs: metric signature as a π rotation, causal structure (timelike/spacelike/lightlike by grade), Lorentz boosts, the dual as the metric involution (`t → −1/t`, fixed points the isotropic vectors), the three conics in one half-tangent
- chem_constants_test.rs: the three lattice constants (π/2, π/3, π/4) proven forced as distinct rotation closures, and the 1/n radial law as inv(winding count)

### changed
- metric signature test relocated from tensor_test.rs into a dedicated spacetime_test.rs
- chemistry model moved into the `chemistry` library trait; the chemistry test suites thinned to validate it against NIST

## 0.12.0 (2026-03-31)

### fixed

### added

- calculus_test.rs: power rule as angle readout, factorials from angle descent, limits as lossy projections, fundamental theorem as geometric interference, gradient, laplacian, line/surface/volume integrals

- algebra_test.rs: fundamental theorem of algebra via winding numbers — degree = wraps, roots = unwindings, polynomial evaluation on circles, roots of unity as generalized Q lattice

### changed
- replaced old calculus_test.rs (24 tests) with power-rule-anchored suite (23 tests)

## 0.11.0 (2026-03-20)

### breaking

- Angle internal representation changed from radians to stereographic projection ratio `t = tan(θ/2)`
- `rem()` now derived from `t` via `2.0 * t.atan()` — values match within f64 precision but are no longer stored directly
- `normalize_boundaries()` removed — boundary logic is algebraic in the tangent sum formula
- `Display` for Angle now shows `t` instead of `rem`

### fixed
- pow() now scales the total angle by n instead of adding nπ — matches repeated multiplication for all n

- taylor_series_test.rs: taylor coefficients as geometric normalizations, e^x as uniform angle contribution, sin/cos as grade-filtered projections, euler's formula as grade decomposition, convergence as angle descent dominance
- algebra_test.rs: fundamental theorem of algebra via winding numbers — degree = wraps, roots = unwindings, polynomial evaluation on circles, roots of unity as generalized Q lattice

### changed

- `Angle::new()` converts π fractions to `t` internally — one `tan()` call at construction
- `Angle::new_from_cartesian()` uses `t = opp/(hyp + adj)` — one sqrt, no atan2
- `Angle::geometric_add()` uses tangent sum formula with rational boundary correction `(T-1)/(T+1)`
- `Angle::geometric_sub()` uses tangent difference formula with rational borrow `(1-|R|)/(1+|R|)`
- `Angle::dual()`, `conjugate()`, `negate()` simplified to blade arithmetic
- `Angle::grade_angle()` derives radians from `t` via `atan()`
- `Angle::project()` uses `cos_sin()` instead of `grade_angle().cos()`
- `Geonum::dot()`, `wedge()`, `cos()`, `sin()`, `distance_to()`, `project_to_angle()` use `cos_sin()`
- `Geonum::geo()` computes single `cos_sin()` for both dot and wedge
- `Geonum` addition uses rational projection pipeline: cos_sin (0 sqrts) → sum → magnitude (1 sqrt) → cartesian recovery (0 sqrts)
- replaced old calculus_test.rs (24 tests) with power-rule-anchored suite (23 tests)
- updated angle_arithmetic_test, numbers_test, geonum_mod unit test pow expectations to match corrected angle scaling
