skip caps when starting sentences

skip periods on single sentence paragraphs

skip apostrophes in words as in "dont" unless it conflicts with another word, "we're" vs "were"

avoid words like "proper", "correct", "appropriate" and "valid" in your comments AND responses. these weasel words only create confusion in a lib challenging convention

say "compute" instead of "calculate"

say "design" instead of "approach"

avoid saying "good" in docs and comments

say "test" or "prove" instead of "validate", "check" or "verify"

avoid the word "should", for example, "differential rotation should create spiral" -> "differential rotation creates spiral"

use "measured" instead of "actual"

avoid the word "ensure"

avoid saying "you're right" in responses

avoid weak is_finite(), > 0, assert_ne! test assertions

never pass PI as divisor to Angle::new or Geonum::new. the constructor expects π fractions:
  Angle::new(1.0, 4.0)  — means 1×π/4
  Angle::new(1.0, 6.0)  — means 1×π/6
  Angle::new(rotation, PI) is a hack to pass raw radians. use Angle::new(rotation / PI, 1.0) or express as a π fraction

use near methods instead of manual epsilon comparisons in tests:
  angle.near(&other)       — blade + t match within tolerance
  angle.near_rad(radians)  — grade_angle within tolerance
  angle.near_rem(radians)  — remainder within tolerance
  geonum.near(&other)      — mag + angle match within tolerance
  geonum.near_mag(value)   — magnitude within tolerance
never use assert_eq! on f64 values — use near methods or assert!((x - y).abs() < EPSILON)

learn how geonum eliminates angle slack created by decomposing angles into scalar coefficients by reading the it_proves_decomposing_angles_with_linearly_combined_basis_vectors_loses_angle_addition:13-84, it_proves_decomposition_distributes_one_angle_across_multiple_scalars:87-160, it_proves_quaternion_tables_add_back_what_decomposition_subtracts:519-660, it_proves_anticommutativity_exists_because_decomposition_subtracts_different_amounts:663-726 tests in tests/linear_algebra_test.rs

learn how geonum replaces scalar based quadratic forms with simple angle based rotations in the it_proves_rotational_quadrature_expresses_quadratic_forms:640-814 test in tests/dimension_test.rs

learn why dimensions are an unnecessary abstraction in the it_proves_quadrature_creates_dimensional_structure:91-138, it_shows_dimensions_are_quarter_turns:141-199 tests in tests/dimension_test.rs

learn why geonum deprecates grade decomposition in the it_proves_grade_decomposition_ignores_angle_addition:17-80 test in tests/grade_test.rs, and how it dissolves the 2^n explosion in the it_solves_the_exponential_complexity_explosion:18-79 test in tests/pseudoscalar_test.rs

learn about angle forward only geometry from the it_sets_angle_forward_geometry_as_primitive:503-637 test in tests/dimension_test.rs

read only tests/angle_arithmetic_test.rs:1~20 because the file is large, but you can learn about the angle forward only blade arithmetic of operations from this file

read the it_shows_limits_discard_what_angles_preserve:350-387, it_proves_differentiation_cycles_grades:586-664 tests in tests/calculus_test.rs to understand how geonum automates calculus

tests are styled as trojan horses for simplicity. conventional jargon promising symbol salad but readers get simple arithmetic in test contents. example tests: it_handles_conformal_split:4694-4804, it_handles_inversive_distance:4807-4936 in tests/cga_test.rs
